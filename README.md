> [!CAUTION]
> This plugin does not adhere to Steam guidelines. Therefore, I do not recommend using it on your server, as it may risk being token banned if Steam decides to enforce such measures again.

> [!WARNING]
> In order to reveal everyone's rank on scoreboard install this great metamod plugin from my friend @Cruze03 https://github.com/Cruze03/FakeRanks-RevealAll/releases/latest
